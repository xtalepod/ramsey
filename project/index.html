  if your are a light house then let me be your guard tower<br>
  we can never really know the moment you’ll drown<br>
  but at least you’d know that i was watching out for you<br>
  and i was ready to swim if i knew it would have made the difference<br>

this time we're looking at it from the left and there is no light house;
just a heavy fog." width="900" height="600" style="float:right; margin:0px 0px 15px 15px; cursor:crosshair; border:0;">

  the last time something like this happened<br>
  i wrote about the surgeon’s hand carving black rock<br>
  territorial nostalgia being broken open at your rib cage<br>
  then as now, the snowing is falling in a way that soaks everything<br>

lake ramsey from another point all together but we're looking into the same void. if you stepped
out onto the water you'd surely drown but if you're patient that will change soon." width="900" height="600" style="float:right; margin:0px 0px 15px 15px; cursor:pointer; cursor:hand; border:0">

  heaving.<br>
  drive all morning, all afternoon, and decide at the door <br>
  the choice is clear: be separated or stay, so stay.<br>
  check in each day and the choice never changes<br>

  so i stay and time changes suddenly,<br>
  what was yesterday is no longer the case for today<br>
  and i realize that, as the surface shifts from slipping into wading,<br>
  i will be here waiting for you to find your way back.<br>

  softly,<br>
  softer still, stiller still<br>
  your wordless voice may she be lulled back into speaking<br>
  on water we will walk together soon, hand in hand.<br>
